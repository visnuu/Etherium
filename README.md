HelloWorld Solidity Program
This Solidity program is a simple "Hello World" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how it works.

Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a single function that returns the string "Hello World!". This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

Getting Started
Executing Program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps:

Go to the Remix website.

Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.

Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol).

Copy and paste the following code into the file:

solidity
Copy code
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

contract HelloWorld {
    function sayHello() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}
Compile the code:

Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version).
Click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.
Deploy the contract:

Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
Select the "HelloWorld" contract from the dropdown menu.
Click on the "Deploy" button.
Interact with the contract:

Click on the deployed "HelloWorld" contract in the left-hand sidebar.
Click on the "sayHello" function.
Click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the "Hello World!" message.
