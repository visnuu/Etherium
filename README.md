# Ethereum-Beg
This is my first simple solidity program which consists of a contract and two functions to mint and burn tokens.

# Deatils
This program is written in solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain.
This program mainly focuses showcasing simple managing of tokens with two primary functions:-
     * nwmint: used for minting new tokens and assigning them to specified addresses
     * nwburn: used for burning tokens from a specified addresses if the address holds enough tokens

# Execution
To run this program, we used Remix, an online IDE.
we create a new file and name it however we want and save it with .sol extension.
copy paste the code from Eth-Beg file and click on compile from compiler tab
go to deploy and deploy the contract and you will find the functions and values there as you have set it
copy the address from any of the already given addresses from remix to use and assign some value to balance
mint some tokens using the address
after you minted the tokens now your burn them
go to burn and use the same address as from mint and choose how much token to burn 
*note: you can not burn more tokens than what you have in your balance
